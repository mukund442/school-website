                  The concept of ‘Our World’ forms the basis of K.R. Mangalam. Learning, irrespective of the source, is learning that K.R. Mangalam derives from the world over, to educate and inspire children towards achievement. Every country, every place, every religion, every action and every reaction teaches us something. K.R. Mangalam is a continuous process of amalgamation- amalgamation of strengths of the newer things that happen in our own world, of things that have happened in the past and of things that can happen in the future. Civilizations, religions, cultures, habits, people, places and events that have changed the course of mankind are the core subjects of knowledge.
  
                  In a systematic endeavour, the course curriculum at K.R. Mangalam is designed to ignite global thinking right from early stages. Eminent people with wide international exposure are inducted to guide and train the students. Books, CD’s and other resources bear a broad universal perspective and encompass a wide spectrum of activities. Special knowledge centers are created on various themes for the benefit of students interested in different areas.
                  
                  The ideology of ‘Our World’ forms the footing of K.R. Mangalam Group of Schools. In this global village, it is mandatory for schools to break their monotonous educational regime and embrace an ardent approach to overcome the hurdles that this ever-changing world has to offer. At K.R. Mangalam, the process of equipping the child with the necessary tools for growth is shaped by blending the strengths of different civilizations, religions, cultures, habits, people, places and events. The curriculum is, thus devised to promote a comprehensive learning environment which will encourage broadening of horizons and manifestation of strengths and capabilities.
                  
                  As rightly said by John F. Kennedy, “Education is a means of developing our greatest abilities, because in each of us there is a private hope and dream which, fulfilled, can be translated into benefit for everyone and greater strength for our nation.” At K.R. Mangalam, this is what we strive for, as quality is never an accident, it is always the result of intelligent effort. Rigor is the key to our high standards. Here, the education is child-centered, and aims at comprehensive all-round development of children. So, teaching styles and techniques are geared to the well-being of the child which leads to his cognitive, affective and curative development.
                  
                  Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. aptly describes the function of education as, “to teach one to think intensively, and to think critically. Intelligence plus character – that is the goal of true education.”
